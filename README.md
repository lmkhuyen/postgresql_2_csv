# postgresql_2_csv


This python script will help to convert all the tables of a PostgreSQL database to csv files, which are easy to import to MySQL

It is able to handle tables with millions of records just fine and really fast (1 million of record in less than 5 minutes)

But the CSV files took a lot of disk space
